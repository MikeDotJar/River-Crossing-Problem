# River-Crossing-Problem
This java program solves the 3 zebras and 3 lions river crossing problem

I had recently viewed a video by Ted Ed on Youtube regarding the River Crossing Riddle. First, I am aware the video involves wildebeests
instead of zebras but I chose zebras because it was easier to type. In the video they mention building a tree is a good way to start and
I thought why not use a program to build a tree and find a solution? I had just recently taken an AI class at my college and I wanted to
apply what I learned to this project. For this, I decided to use Breadth-First Search since it was one of the first algorithms we used
and I wanted to avoid using more complicated search algorithms like A* Search since it is only an 11-step problem.

Here's a link to the Ted Ed video in case you want to see it for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=ADR7dUoVh_c
